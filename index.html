      <h3>Welcome to the Looker SSO Embed Demo Builder!</h3>
      <de>
        This tool allows you to quickly create and customize visually appealing
        Looker SSO embed demos with ease. Whether you're building an interactive
        demo or testing embedding content, this tool helps you streamline the
        process. Simply follow the navigation bottom right through the setup
        pages and finally have a look at your custom demo.
      </de>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <in>
        <strong>1) Setup:</strong><br />
        Use the three sections within this page to customize the general layout,
        buttons & sub-pages of your demo page. Make sure to save your
        configuration!<br /><br />
        <strong>2) Embed:</strong><br />
        Define all inputs necessary to create a valid SSO URL. Make sure to save
        your configuration in order to run a background script processing an
        embed-URL & displaying it within the iframe on the demo page.<br />
        <strong>Remember:</strong>
        Add a theme to your embed path to make your demo visually even
          more appealing!</em
        ><br /><br />
        <strong>3) Demo:</strong><br />
        Use this page to test your setup or to demo embed capabilities of
        looker.<br />
        <strong>Remember:</strong> 
        SOO URLs are only valid once. Navigating back
        and forth from the demo page will invalidate the URL. You need to re-save
        the configuration on the embed page to establish a new SSO URL.
